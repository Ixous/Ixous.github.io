        Take a look at medicine two hundred years ago, now then at medicine today.<br>
        Now take a look at a classroom from two hundred years ago, and then one where students learn today.
        Almost every aspect of society has changed compared to a century ago, even from a few decades ago. Yet
        education has stayed pretty much the same. Higher education, for the most part, is still taught in large
        lecture halls by teachers following a linear narrative and a unique pace.

        <p class="text">
        We make efforts to get as many people in higher education as possible and increase diversity to give everyone a
        fair chance, yet most institutions are still run using outdated methods which worked for the more traditional
        students of the past. The way we teach and assess reflects the real goal of education : not teaching knowledge
        and abilities, but sorting students the way we grade products out of a factory line. In his book The Case
        against
        Education, Bryan Caplan, Professor of Economics, calls out higher education for being but a signaling tool for
        recruiters and for not actually promoting personal improvement and learning.

        Our parents or grands-parents went to a school structured around memorization and recitation, where corporal
        punishments and humiliation illustrated the fundamental values of the time : obedience, order, authority.
        Students had to stay in line and deviation from the standard universal traditional path was rejected. Over the
        years, the pedagogy shifted and education evolved to take in as many as possible to meet the needs of the
        ever-growing industrial economy of the war-time and post-war era.

        We now still see the remanence of that past. The author and advisor on education Sir Ken Robinson compares
        school with a factory line along which children are conveyed by batches according to their date of manufactory,
        educated in strait rows on a strict schedule with ringing bells, assessed through quality control with standardized
        tests, and finally graded by their quality with a single letter to be selected on the job market.

        Each individual is different, and learns differently. Some may prefer to work at certain time of the day, in
        groups or alone, using different methods and tools. Moreover, a particular concept might be easy and quick to
        grasp and learn for some, while others would need a little extra time, but the schedule is rock-hard and the
        curriculum needs to march on relentlessly. The current system is based on uniformity and instruction, while it
        should go the other way around, to diversity. Education should amplify not equalize because society depends on
        a diversity of talents and ability.

        <p class="text">
        The current school system seems to only care about how much of the material has been memorized while at the
        same
        time not leaving the time and opportunity for everyone to master anything. A passing grade should be 100%,
        anything but that is a recipe for future difficulties, frustration and resignation. A disappointing score might
        leave a student thinking they are just not good enough, and that is a fatal mindset on the road to learning and
        fulfilling ones dreams. Salman Khan, the founder of the Khan Academy, repeatedly uses the metaphor of building
        a house. If you decide to build the first floor while the foundations are not finished, the house will collapse.
        Likewise, if one learns on weak understanding and swiss-cheese knowledge, they are bound to run into more and
        more obstacles.
