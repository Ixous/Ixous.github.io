            As promised, more of my Ternary Computer project. In the previous article on the topic, I built the basic gates (NOT, NAND, NOR, NCONS, NANY) on breadboards using the CD4007 chip. However, the goal is tu build a 3-trit ALU, which requires many many gates. Therefore, I decided to manufature PCBs for the different gates and then build more complex circuits like Lego.

            First, let's calculate how many gates and thus PCBs and chips we will need. A while ago, I wrote an article about the design of a ternary ALU, however, as I stated in this article, we can actually use a slightly different design with inverters, or lack of inverters, to do the same function but inverted and spare many chips.
