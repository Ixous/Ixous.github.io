        <p class="text">
            In a previous article about my Ternary Computer, I built the basic gates (NOT, NAND, NOR, NCONS, NANY) on breadboards using the CD4007 chip. However, the goal is to build a 3-trit ALU, which requires many many gates. Therefore, I decided to manufacture PCBs for the different gates and then build more complex circuits like Lego.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Instead of having a mess cables everywhere for power and data running between free floating PCBs, I decided to mount everything on a structure both for stability, readability and power delivery. The key component is some 40pins triple-width female headers.
        </p>
        <div class="center_block">

        <p class="text">
            By connecting the columns into three rails, we can easily mount and power multiple devices with angled male headers on the side.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Then, the PCBs. I designed everything with EasyEDA because it is easy to use, it's simple, I don't need more advanced features and it's integrated with JLCPCB to order the PCBs. I prefer placing the components and routing everything by hand.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            As I said in the previous article, here is the list of PCBs :
        </p>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>2x(NOT+NNOT+PNOT) = 2 chips</li>
            <li>NAND = 2 chips</li>
            <li>NOR = 2 chips</li>
            <li>NCONS = 2 chips</li>
            <li>NANY = 2 chips</li>
            <li>MUL = 7 chips</li>
            <li>NSUM+NCONS = 10 chips</li>
            <li>3-trit LED display = 2 chips</li>
            <li>Power rail bridge connector</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            The basic gates with 2 chips only can fit on a small PCB about 3x4cm. Other require a multiple of this basic size unit. Here are the schematics of the PCBs. To save on cost, I decided to panel multiple together with small 3mm bridges (the smallest JLCPCB accepted) and will just have to cut them and file the edges flat.

        <p class="text">
            As you can see I also added labels and schematics to show which board is which gate. I ordered a bunch of them on JLCPCB and got them manufactured and delivered in about a week.

            It will take a bit of time to solder everything in place and I don't have that much free time right now. I still wanted to at least check if it worked. I soldered a NCONS gate and put the chips in.

            Fortunately, It works like a charm. I also tested the header power rails.

            I am very satisfied with how it looks and works. Hopefully the next article will be about putting everything together and finishing the ALU. Stay tuned !
