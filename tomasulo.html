        <p class="text">
            This small project was an assignment for ECE6100 - Advanced Computer Architecture at Georgia Tech. The task was to implement Tomasulo's algorithm, an instruction scheduling algorithm that allows for Out-Of-Order execution and parallelization of operations on multiple functional units. I implemented the algorithm in Python. The simulator is heavily configurable and outputs to a text file a table with each row describing the state of the processor at one cycle.
        </p>

        <h2>The algorithm</h2>

        <h3>Overview of the architecture</h3>

        <p class="text">
            The processor is based on the Tomasulo’s architecture. The instructions are loaded into an instruction queue waiting to be issued to reservation stations. Reservation stations are grouped into three banks, one for add and subtract operations, one for multiply and divide operations, and one for load and store operations. Instructions in reservation stations wait for their operands to be resolved (from the register bank or the common data bus) and for an available functional unit to begin execution. The functional units are either dedicated to add/subtract operations, or multiply/divide operations (with a parameter to differentiate functional units for multiply and divide operations). The load/store reservation stations are arranged in a circular buffer (table with read and write pointers) and the operations in this buffer are handled sequentially in order.
        </p>

                Tomasulo's algorithm
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text">
            Each entry in the reservation stations for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations contains the mnemonics of the function, the tag (source) of each operand, the value of each operand when available, and a reference to the functional unit when being executed.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Each entry in a functional unit contains the mnemonics of the function, the value of each operand, the result of the operation at the end of execution, a reference to the reservation station and a execution countdown initiated to the duration of the operation in question at the start of execution, then decremented each cycle down to zero when the execution is over and the result is ready to be broadcast.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The load/store circular reservation station bank is implemented with a read and a write pointer in a linear table. Both pointers are initialized to the first element. Then, when a memory manipulation instruction is issued, it is placed in the reservation station pointed to by the write pointer (if it is available, otherwise this means the buffer is full), and the write pointer is incremented. When an instruction is completed and its result is broadcast, the reservation station is emptied and the read pointer is incremented. Each entry of those reservation stations contains the mnemonic of the instruction, the sink (target, register or memory), the source (‘D’ for direct value, ‘F#’ for register #, ‘M#’ for memory), the value of the source when available and the execution timer similar to the functional units.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The common data bus contains simply the tag of the reservation station broadcasting its result, and the value.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Each entry of the register bank contains the value currently held by the register, and if an instruction in the pipeline targets this register, then the tag of the corresponding reservation station.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The memory is implemented with a Python dictionary. The key is the memory address and the value is the number stored at that address. If the address read is not in the dictionary (it has not been written to yet), then the value of zero is returned.
        </p>

        <h3>The instruction set</h3>

        <p class="text">
            This processor model uses a very simplified instruction set. Each line of assembly code starts with a three letters mnemonic followed by operands separated by spaces. Most operands can either be a direct value (42, -10), a register reference (F0, F7) or a memory address (M0, M512). Note that the processor also supports relative memory addressing (M512-16, M512+16).
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The ADD, SUB, MUL and DIV instructions use the same syntax and allow addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations. The first operand provided is the target register. The next two operands (direct value or register) are the arguments.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The LOD (load) operation can also be used to write a value to a register. The first operand is the target register. The second operand is the source, either a direct value, another register, or a memory address.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The STR (store) operation is used to write to memory. The first operand is the memory address, and the second operand is the source (direct value, register or memory address).
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Finally, the NOP (no-operation) instruction doesn’t take any operand and is simply discarded when issued. It can be used to wait one cycle.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            There is no branching instruction as this assignment was focused on Tomasulo's algorithm only and not other parts of the pipeline. There is no binary operations either but implementing the corresponding Functional Units and Reservation Stations is trivial and not interesting.
        </p>

        <h3>The parameters</h3>

        <p class="text">
            At the top of the source file of the program is a list of parameters that can be adjusted with their default value (that will be used for the examples, except with exceptions explicitly mentioned later) and description.

        <h2>Examples</h2>


        <p class="text">
            The program produces a text file describing the state of the machine at each cycle. The text file should be read on a text editor with word wrap disabled, a monospace font and no line spacing.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The outputs of the example programs are provided in the archive of this project. For each example, register F0 is initialized to the value 1 and register F1 is initialized to the value 2. Also, to make the examples shorter and easier to read, the execution for add/subtract operations is 2 cycles, multiply is 4 cycles and divide is 6 operations. Instructions are referred to I# with # the number of the line starting at 1.
        </p>

        <h3>Hazards</h3>

        <p class="text">
            Those three basic programs test that the architecture is able to deal with potential data hazards : Read-After-Write, Write-After-Read and Write-After-Write.
