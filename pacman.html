            This project was the final assignment for ECE6122 - Advanced Programming Techniques at GeorgiaTech. The task was to develop a multi-threaded Pacman game in 3D using OpenGL and C++. The AIs of the ghosts replicate those of the original game and are running on separate threads.

            Here is the video report I made for the assignment.

            This was a fun little project. I hadn't touched OpenGL in years, and diving into how the original Pacman created interesting ghost behavior from very simple rules was exciting. There really isn't much to explain, hence why this article is so short.
