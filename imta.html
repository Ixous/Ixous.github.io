            After they saw my work for Junior Atlantique, which I already made an article about, my school, IMT Atlantique, hired me to create some communication supports for them. The original contract was for four small one minute videos similar to what I had made for JA. Things deviated during the project. If I sound angry, it's because I am, even when writing this article over a year after the fact.

            Disclaimer, this project might reflect a poor image of me. But I would rather like to emphasize an image of perfectionism and being able to put up with a lot before criticizing. Anyway, salt incoming.

            First, I worked on a video that was made by other students. I 'just had to finish it'. It was a video filmed with a GoPro camera in front of a green-screen. The green-screen was full of giant wrinkles, they used only one light source for the whole scene (you are supposed to light up the green-screen much more than the subject), the GoPro had auto exposure changing every time something moved, and worst of all, they had already made fade-to-black transitions BEFORE removing the green-screen. Moreover, they used sheets of paper with stock illustrations taken straight from Google Images with watermarks still on them, and they wrote typo-filled half-motivating messages with a default font, no consistence in alignment, margin or size, and terrible colors. This was a disaster. I struggled to make something out of it with some motion design animations, but the result is still terrible. I wont show it there, or anywhere.

            They also asked me to check some scripts they wrote in English. You would think people working in international relations at a school trying to reach students from all around the world would know English. You would be wrong... They could even translate Europe properly. Europe in French is Europe in English. Easy. Not 'Europa'... Arggg !

            Then I worked with them on a project they had to market a slogan : the YOU, representing the three years of education with three words : Yourself, Open-minded, Up-to-you. (Think of it what you want). So I had to create a series of logos for this project. This is what we arrived at :

                I just noticed I used the same font as for this website... I just love it I guess

            Anyway, that was nothing. Then the main task. Not four one-minute videos, but one 10 minutes video ! In motion design, with tons of information to include. Anyway, I did what I could. I am not a professional of Digital Art. I worked probably around 70h on this video including script, audio, illustration and animation. The last third of the video was done during the last *night* of work and I decided to speed up. This was not in the contract, I was being too generous and perfectionist.

            All-in-all, this project was a mess. The problems all arose from miscommunication. I assumed people working in communication and marketing would understand how illustration and animation worked and the work behind even one minute of animation. When they asked me for modifications on the video and further polishing, I rejected, told them that I did what would have cost them 20 times what I was paid and that I was drained of my energy. I was paid. I don't know if they ended up using this video or not. I don't care. I'm still half-proud of it and I improved a lot in illustration and animation during this project. I also learned once again that being perfectionist is painful and can be detrimental when working with and for other people than myself.
